# full-stack-roadmap
🔧 Tech Stack Overview (Beginner-Friendly & Free)
Frontend: React + Next.js (you already know this!)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js (simple, JavaScript-based)

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL, free-tier on MongoDB Atlas)

API Testing: Postman or Thunder Client (VSCode extension)

Auth: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for simplicity

Hosting:

Frontend: Vercel (free, made for Next.js)

Backend: Railway / Render / Cyclic

Database: MongoDB Atlas (free tier)

🛠️ Full Stack App Idea (Optional Example)
Project: “DevConnect” – A mini portfolio + blog + message board for developers
Why? Combines: CRUD, Auth, DB queries, APIs, deployment – everything you need to learn.

🗺️ Step-by-Step Plan
🔹 Step 1: Plan Your App
Decide features (e.g., user signup/login, post blog, contact form)

Design basic UI/UX (use Figma or draw on paper)

Define API routes (GET /posts, POST /login, etc.)

Draw a database schema (collections or tables and fields)

🔹 Step 2: Set Up Frontend (Next.js)
Create a new Next.js app (npx create-next-app@latest)

Set up basic pages (/, /login, /dashboard, etc.)

Add a simple form to test posting data

Use fetch or axios to call backend endpoints

🔹 Step 3: Learn & Build the Backend (Node.js + Express)
Learn:

What is a server?

What are REST APIs?

How Express handles routes, middleware, errors

Do:

Create a new backend folder/project

Install Express (npm init -y && npm install express)

Create REST endpoints:

GET /api/posts

POST /api/login

Return dummy data first

MDN: Express basics

🔹 Step 4: Add a Database (MongoDB)
Learn:

What is a database vs collection vs document?

Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Connecting MongoDB to Express using Mongoose

Do:

Set up MongoDB Atlas (free tier)

Use Mongoose in your backend to create models (e.g., User, Post)

Replace dummy data with actual DB operations

📚 Suggested resource:

Mongoose Docs

MongoDB University - Free Courses

🔹 Step 5: Add Authentication
Learn:

What is authentication vs authorization?

How JWT works

Basic password hashing using bcrypt

Do:

Create routes like:

POST /api/register (hash password and store)

POST /api/login (verify password, issue token)

Protect routes with JWT middleware

📚 Resource:

JWT Auth in Node.js – Net Ninja YouTube

🔹 Step 6: Connect Frontend to Backend
Use axios or fetch in Next.js to call your API

Store JWT in localStorage or cookies

Use conditional rendering for protected pages

Handle error messages and loading states

🔹 Step 7: Learn DevOps Basics & Deploy
Learn:

What is deployment?

What is CI/CD?

Environment variables, build steps

Deploy:

Frontend: Vercel (easy for Next.js)

Backend: Railway or Render (free & Node.js-friendly)

Database: MongoDB Atlas (already cloud-hosted)

📚 Deployment Resource:

Deploy Express API to Render

Vercel + Next.js docs

🔹 Step 8: Polish & Add Extras
Pagination, file uploads (e.g., image for blogs)

Filters/search (query params)

Role-based auth (admin vs user)

Dashboard charts using Chart.js or ApexCharts

Use .env files for secrets

🔹 Step 9: Version Control and Collaboration
Set up GitHub repo

Commit code regularly

Write a good README.md

Optional: Use GitHub Projects or Notion to track tasks

🔹 Step 10: Keep Growing
Learn PostgreSQL & SQL (once comfortable)

Explore ORMs like Prisma

Try Docker for containerizing your backend

Learn CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions
